Using React JS, Babel, SASS, & Marked API, this mark down editor was desigend to aid in the process of creating simple markdown documents. The mark down preview will update as the user inputs text and mark down tags. CLear button will clear out the text area. If you have questions, feel free to message me or us the 'issues' feature of Github.
