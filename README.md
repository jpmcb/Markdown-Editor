# Markdown Editor & Preview Engine

Using the React JavaScript library, Babel, SASS, & the Marked API, this mark down editor was desigend to aid in the process of creating simple markdown documents. The markdown preview will update as the user inputs text and basic markdown tags. Clear button will clear out the text area. If you have questions, feel free to message me or us the 'issues' feature of Github.

Thanks to [Marked API](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for the awesome open source parser!

A working version of the app can be [found here](https://jpmcb.github.io/Markdown-Editor/)
